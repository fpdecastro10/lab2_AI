    DESCRIPTION: First, we return positive or negative infinity, depending on whether the game state indicates a victory or a defeat. 
    Next, we figure out how far it is to the nearest food pellet and penalise Pac-Man by taking the inverse of this distance. 
    We also take into consideration, with commensurate penalties, the distance to the nearest scared and non-scared ghost. 
    We also penalise the overall amount of capsules and food pellets left, hoping to incentivize Pac-Man to finish them. 
    To fine-tune Pac-Man's behaviour in various game conditions, you can change the weights attached to these penalties.
    Pac-Man is encouraged to prioritise nearby food, steer clear of non-scared ghosts, 
    and specifically target scared ghosts due to negative weights assigned to distances to food, non-scared ghosts, and scared ghosts. 
    We modified the weights by trying diferent executations in the map provided to find the configuration that suits better to it.
